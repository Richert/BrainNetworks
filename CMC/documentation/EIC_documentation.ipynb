    "The model described here is a simple neural population model consisting of an excitatory and an inhibitory neural population. As shown below, the populations express both intra-population coupling and bi-directional inter-population coupling.\n",

    "-include image-\n",
    "\n",
    "Each population is represented by an extended Montbrio model (Montbrio et al. 2015). The Montbrio model is a mathematically exact mean-field description of the macroscopic state of a globally coupled quadratic integrate-and-fire population. The dynamics of its average membrane potential $v$ and average firing rate $r$ follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{r} = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\pi \\tau^2} + \\frac{2 r v}{\\tau}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{v} = \\frac{v^2 + \\overline{\\eta} + J r + I(t)}{\\tau} - \\tau \\pi^2 r^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\tau$ is the lumped time-constant of the membrane, $J$ is a coupling constant, $I$ is an extrinsic input current and $\\overline{\\eta}$ and $\\Delta$ are parameters of a Lorentzian probability distribution describing the distribution of firing thresholds in the neural population. This model is extended by synaptic response dynamics. In particular, each population has an inhibitory and an excitatory synapse that formulate a convolution of synaptic input $r_{e/i}$ with an alpha kernel:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{v_{e/i}} =  \\frac{H_{e/i}}{\\tau_{e/i}} r_{e/i} - \\frac{v_{e/i}}{\\tau_{e/i}^2} - \\frac{2 I_{e/i}}{\\tau_{e/i}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{I_{e/i}} = v_{e/i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the subscripts $e$ and $i$ mark whether the synapse is excitatory or inhibitory. This convolution models the dynamics of the synaptic input current $I_{e/i}$ as an exponential rise and decay with a single time-constant $\\tau_{e/i}$ and a synaptic efficacy $H_{e/i}$. \n",
    "Finally, a short-term plasticity mechanism is added to the model, to account for experimentally observed saturations of firing rate responses to constant input (include citation). This short-term plasticity is defined over the mean of the distribution of firing thresholds $\\overline{\\eta}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{\\overline{\\eta}} = \\frac{\\eta_0 - \\overline{\\eta} - \\alpha r}{\\tau_{\\eta}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which describes an exponential attraction of $\\overline{\\eta}$ to the resting threshold mean $\\eta_0$ with a time-constant $\\tau_{\\eta}$.\n",
    "This leads to the following set of coupled differential equations that define the dynamics of a single, excitatory neural population:\n",

    "$$\\dot{I_{i}} = v_{i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $I_{ext}$ is an extrinsic input current. To model an inhibitory population, the term $J r$ simply needs to be transferred from the excitatory synapse to the inhibitory synapse.\n",
    "Based on the the parametrizations used in Jansen \\& Rit (1995) and Montbrio et al. (2015), I used the following initial set of parameters:\n",
